# Dignified Winers

## Project Description

Dignified Winers is a full-stack CRUD application using MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js(MERN stack). Upon the landing page, users can navigate to our full wine list, learn more about the company, see featured wines through a carousel and have the option to join our community. When browsing all wines, the user can search by wine name and click on each wine to learn more detail. Users who sign up to be a part of the Winer community have the option to add a submission of their favorite wine to be ranked by the panel of experts. These submissions have the option of edit and delete.
